# PureDocs [OLD]
Puredocs is a powerfull and very simple documentation software designed to work simply from a single HTML file without the need for NPM etc.

## Powerfull, yet simple
The script generates the hard part for you.<br>
You can just create sections, and the rest (Navigation, links, headers) will get automatically generated.<br>
You can add code snipets, warn/info/error notes, code sandboxes and much more with minimal code.

## Minimal setup
You need to copy-paste one file to create your own PureDocs.<br>That's it.

## Customizable
PureDocs are fully customizable, from endless themes to brand new styles.
